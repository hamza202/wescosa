                        Wahah Electric Supply Company of Saudi Arabia Ltd. (WESCOSA) was formed in 1976 to meet the
                        growing
                        needs of energy and power sector in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
                        <br><br>
                        WESCOSA has experienced substantial growth since its formation. The company now offers a
                        wide-range
                        of products designed and manufactured to meet the highest quality standards of the power
                        generation
                        and distribution industry.
                        <br><br>
                        At the beginning, WESCOSA’s product line includes only the assembly of switchboards, panel
                        boards
                        and accessories under a license agreement with Westinghouse Electric Corporation, USA. The
                        demand of
                        electrical equipment in Saudi Arabia has fast risen in the succeeding years, causing WESCOSA to
                        diversify its product lines and started manufacturing NEMA VE-1 Electrical Cable Ladders, Cable
                        Tray, and Cable Trunking & Supports.

                        The company has grown tremendously at an early stage of its operation. In 1979, WESCOSA started
                        assembling oil filled transformers under a license agreement with Westinghouse Electric
                        Corporation. Assembly of dry type transformer was added to WESCOSA products in 1983, again under
                        a license agreement with Westinghouse. In 1988, Westinghouse sold its transformer division to
                        WESCOSA. Since, then WESCOSA has continued manufacturing oil filled distribution transformers of
                        the highest quality standards independently, now holding its own type-test certifications.

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p class="text-justify ">
                        It was in 1988 when a major turn of event took place in WESCOSA when Ali Zaid Al-Quraishi &
                        Bros. Co. purchased the Westinghouse share making WESCOSA a fully owned subsidiary of Ali Zaid
                        Al-Quraishi & Bros. Co. and since then WESCOSA named as Wahah Electric Supply Company of Saudi
                        Arabia Ltd., a 100% Saudi Arabian Company. Eventually, on the same year, Westinghouse sold its
                        transformer division to a new owner, thereby ending its license agreement with WESCOSA. Since
                        then, WESCOSA has continued manufacturing oil filled distribution transformers of high quality
                        standards independently. WESCOSA now hold its own type-test certifications.
                        <br><br>
                        The success-story has just begun; in early 1992, WESCOSA added Metal-Clad Vacuum Switchgear,
                        under a technical license agreement with Powell Industries Inc. USA. The same year when WESCOSA
                        started manufacturing AMPGARD Medium Voltage Starters and Low Voltage Motor Control Centers
                        (MCC’s) series 2100 and DS Low Voltage Switchgear under a license agreement with Westinghouse
                        Electric Corporation. In the following year, UNIBUS Inc., of USA entered a license agreement
                        with WESCOSA enabling the latter to start manufacturing Non-Segregated Busducts and in the same
                        year, WESCOSA started producing Distribution Transformers of their own design for both ANSI and
                        IEC standards.
                        <br><br>
                        The license agreements which WESCOSA had with Westinghouse were all extended by Eaton
                        Corporation through its subsidiary, Cutler-Hammer. In early 2000, C-H and WESCOSA enhanced their
                        cooperation by replacing the former license agreement with a Strategic OEM Alliance Agreement.

                        Saudi Arabia being known as the number one oil producing country in the world, had a booming
                        projects in petrochemical and Power industry. This prospective was never neglected by WESCOSA,
                        In 1996 WESCOSA started manufacturing Power transformers and continue to grow and acquire higher
                        ratings as it progress. Now, WESCOSA manufactures transformers up to 20MVA under the technical
                        support agreement with CG-Belgium Transformers. Along with the newly acquired products such as
                        IEC LV Switchgear/control gear with Hensel, Relay and Control Panel, Synchronizing Panel and
                        Instrument Cabinets, WESCOSA is now considerably a one-stop-shop of your electrical needs.
